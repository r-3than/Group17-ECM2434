# App Feedback (Sprint 1)

### Product:
Prototype was good demo. More focus on sustainability in choice of challenges required.

### Process:
Minutes and Attendance were helpful. Meeting workload limits, possibly split up tasks further.

### Technical:
Better readme, backend development in parallel to front end was good.
Need testing for the actual django app.
Range of branches used along with actions.
Improve documentation (include licence).
