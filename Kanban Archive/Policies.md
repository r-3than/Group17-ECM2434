# Kanban Policies

### Kanban Board

The Kanban Board is the main point of reference for the project. It should be kept up to date by the team in order to reflect development progress and to decide on what to do next in the project.

A screenshot of the Kanban board will be taken after each meeting to make sure that the project is progressing well enough, and this should help in setting realistic goals.

The different sections of the Kanban board will start by having a Work-In-Progress (WIP) limit set to 6 tasks per collumn to make sure the team is following the Kanban approach. This limit may be modified throughout the project timeline if deemed necessary.

### Group Meetings

The team should do its best to ensure that the maximum number of members can attend group meetings. If this is not possible, a "catch-up" meeting should be organised to allow everyone to be on the same page.

Team members should also make a note of at least one point to discuss during the group meetings prior to these. This might include a new feature, an issue, a sketch, and idea, etc.

The content of these group meetings should be recorded.

### Client Meetings

Client meetings are essential to understanding the requirements of the product, and to discuss product features, considerations or concerns with the client directly. Hence every member of the team should do their best to attend them.

The content of these client meetings should be recorded so that relevant adjustments can be made to the product or the project timeline.

### Working Hours

In case a team member is consistently working extra hours or feels like they have taken up too much work, they should mention it during a group meeting so that the work can be balanced correctly.

### Dealing with Issues

If a task is taking too long to complete, the team should consider bringing it back to the design stage and potentially splitting it into more subtasks.

If a team member is struggling with a task or bug, they should let the rest of the team know through the group Discord chat (for smaller bugs) or GitHub (for larger problems, such as those requiring design changes).
